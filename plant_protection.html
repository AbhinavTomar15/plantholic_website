                    There are insects and pests trying to infest the plant as a principle of nature. Often they tend to

                        The oil coats the bodies of the insects, effectively suffocating them, as it blocks the pores

                        An oil extracted from the seeds of the neem tree is a powerful natural insecticide, capable of
                        disrupting the life cycle of insects at all stages (adult, larvae, and egg), making it a great
                        resource for the organic gardener. <br>

                        Neem oil acts as a hormone disruptor and as an "antifeedant" for insects that feed on leaves and
                        other plant parts. Neem oil is biodegradable and is nontoxic to pets, birds, fish, and other
                        wildlife

                        Diatomaceous earth has a number of uses in and around the home, and acting as a natural

                        but instead by virtue of its abrasive qualities and its affinity for absorbing the lipids (a
                        waxy substance) from insects' exoskeleton, which then dehydrates them to death.

                        Garlic is well-known for its pungent aroma, which is delectable to some and yet repellent to
                        others, and it is this strong scent that comes into play when used as a natural insecticide.
                        Actually, it's not really clear if garlic spray and chile spray (below) are actually
                        insecticides or are more likely insect repellents, but either way, these common kitchen
                        ingredients can be used to knock down, or even knock out, insect infestations in the garden.

                        Similar to garlic spray, chile pepper spray is a great homemade natural insect repellent that
                        can be used for a variety of different pests. Chile spray can be made from either fresh hot
                        peppers or chile pepper powder. <br>

                        To make a basic chile spray from pepper powder, mix one tablespoon of chile powder with one
                        quart of water and several drops of mild liquid soap. This mixture can be used full-strength on
                        the leaves of affected plants.

                        Although there are many more natural pesticides available, such as Bt (a soil microbe toxic to
                        certain insects), milky spore (also a microbe), nicotine (extracted as a tea from bulk tobacco),
                        pyrethrum (derived from a variety of daisy), and iron phosphate (a natural mineral toxic to
                        slugs and snails), the above natural and homemade insecticide recipes should give you a good
                        starting point for creating your own version. Every organic gardener seems to have their own
                        particular blend and ratio of ingredients, so by paying close attention to the effects of a
                        specific recipe, it's possible to modify it to best suit your own insect battles.

                Hot chile peppers can be very potent for humans as well. Be sure to wear gloves when handling them, and
                keep any sprays that use them away from the eyes, nose, and mouth.

                Just remember, killing off all of the insects in your garden is not the desired result here, as any
                healthy ecosystem requires an abundance of beneficial insects, microbes, and fungi, both in the soil and
                on the plants themselves, so introducing other predatory insects (ladybugs, praying mantis, etc.) or
                creating good habitat for them, as well as building soil fertility, can also be an effective pest
                management approach.

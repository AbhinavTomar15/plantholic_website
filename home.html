                    Most people enjoy having trees around their homes, plants in their houses, and nature in general.
                    However, they may not always understand the importance of plants in their everyday lives. From an
                    environmental impact to personal enjoyment, a world without
                    plants would be catastrophic. <br><br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b> <u> Importance of Plants for Our Lives </u> </b> <br><br> Although there are many ways that you
                    could say plants are important, one key aspect is overall good health. Eating a plant-based diet
                    improves your health and is an important
                    part of a balanced diet. The MD Anderson Cancer Center strongly suggests eating a diet that’s rich
                    in fruits and vegetables which are all types of plants. You might not necessarily think about plants
                    for their culinary uses but probably
                    at least half of the foods in your diet contain plants in some form. <br><br> From salads to
                    desserts and much more, plants are an important and even essential part of our food system. If you
                    didn’t have plants as an option in your
                    diet, then you would mostly be eating meat and have much more limited options. Additionally, most
                    people could also benefit from increasing their intake of fruits and vegetables and reducing meat
                    consumption. Some of the healthiest
                    populations with low levels of chronic diseases follow a mostly vegetarian diet. <br><br> Plants
                    also play an aesthetic role in our lives though. Think about the average home and how even a few
                    houseplants can make a big difference.
                    They help to freshen the air and add a nice touch to most rooms. Many plants are versatile and grow
                    well in homes so they are a great way to refresh or add a nice touch to a home without doing a
                    complete remodel. Plants both inside
                    and outside are an enjoyable part of life, even if we don’t always realize their impact. <br><br>
                    Finally,
                    <b>plants can help us to be more active.</b> If you have a home with a garden or plants, then you’re
                    probably going to be doing some maintenance. From pruning and weeding, just having plants in the
                    home is going to make you more active.
                    This doesn’t mean that everyone is going to spend hours a week on plant care, but it’s a good way to
                    get some exercise and a type of exercise that most people enjoy.

                Through human evolution, the human eye can distinguish between 2,000 shades of green, but only 100
                shades of red. Recognizing the different shades of green was important when you were about to eat it or
                use it for shelter or medicine. This could be one
                of the reasons why we feel so comfortable around plants. Being surrounded by nature softens this harsh
                environment, acting as an ease to stress and fatigue. <br>

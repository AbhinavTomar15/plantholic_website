                        Aloe Vera is also called the <b> “Miracle plant” </b>. There are good reasons for this. It’s
                        renowned worldwide for having medicinal properties that rejuvenate, soothe and heal the human

                        thick and fleshy leaves with serrated margins. While it grows wild in several tropical climates,
                        it alsogrows indoor successfully as a potted plant. It is relatively resistant to most insect
                        pests. Which again means you don’t have

                        bears small flowers which come in several colors. The flowers are collected in a dense spiral on

                        totem pole to help it climb easily.
